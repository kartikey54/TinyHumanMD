      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Gestational Age &amp; Corrected Age</h2>

      <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question">How is gestational age calculated from the last menstrual period (LMP)?<svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none"><path d="M4 6l4 4 4-4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"/></svg></button><div class="faq-answer"><p><strong>Gestational age (GA)</strong> is calculated from the first day of the mother's last menstrual period (LMP) using <strong>Naegele's rule</strong>. The estimated due date (EDD) is LMP + 280 days (40 weeks). GA at any given date equals the number of days from LMP to that date, expressed in weeks and days.</p><p>For example, if the LMP was January 1 and today is March 15, that is 73 days, or <strong>10 weeks and 3 days gestational age</strong>. First-trimester ultrasound dating may be used to adjust GA if it differs from LMP-based dating by more than 5-7 days.</p></div></div>

      <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question">What is the difference between corrected age and chronological age?<svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none"><path d="M4 6l4 4 4-4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"/></svg></button><div class="faq-answer"><p><strong>Chronological age</strong> (also called postnatal age) is the time since birth. <strong>Corrected age</strong> (also called adjusted age) accounts for prematurity by subtracting the number of weeks born early from the chronological age.</p><p>Formula: <strong>Corrected age = Chronological age − (40 weeks − GA at birth)</strong>. For example, a baby born at 28 weeks who is now 6 months chronological age has a corrected age of 6 months − 3 months = <strong>3 months corrected</strong>. Most AAP guidelines recommend using corrected age for developmental milestones until <strong>24 months for weight/height</strong> and <strong>18 months for head circumference</strong>.</p></div></div>

      <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question">How do you calculate the estimated due date (EDD)?<svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none"><path d="M4 6l4 4 4-4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"/></svg></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>The <strong>estimated due date (EDD)</strong> is calculated as LMP + 280 days using <strong>Naegele's rule</strong>, which assumes a 28-day menstrual cycle with ovulation on day 14. This calculator also supports deriving EDD from other known data: if you enter a birth date and GA at birth, the EDD is back-calculated.</p><p>Modern obstetric practice often adjusts the EDD based on <strong>first-trimester ultrasound</strong>, which is the most accurate method (±5 days accuracy at 8-13 weeks). ACOG recommends that the EDD should be adjusted if the ultrasound date differs by more than 5 days in the first trimester.</p></div></div>

      <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question">When should I stop correcting for prematurity?<svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none"><path d="M4 6l4 4 4-4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"/></svg></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>AAP guidelines recommend correcting for prematurity until <strong>24 months of age</strong> for weight and height assessments, and <strong>18 months</strong> for head circumference. For developmental milestones, correction is generally applied until <strong>2-3 years of age</strong>, depending on the degree of prematurity.</p><p>In practice: late preterm infants (34-36 weeks) may "catch up" by 12-18 months, while extremely preterm infants (&lt; 28 weeks) may benefit from correction through 30-36 months. Beyond these ages, most children have caught up to their peers, and corrected age is no longer necessary.</p></div></div>

      <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question">What is postmenstrual age (PMA) and how is it used in the NICU?<svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none"><path d="M4 6l4 4 4-4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"/></svg></button><div class="faq-answer"><p><strong>Postmenstrual age (PMA)</strong> = gestational age at birth + postnatal age. For example, a baby born at 26 weeks who is now 4 weeks old has a PMA of <strong>30 weeks</strong>. PMA is the standard age metric used in the NICU for clinical decision-making.</p><p>PMA is used to guide: <strong>caffeine therapy</strong> for apnea of prematurity (typically until 34-36 weeks PMA), <strong>retinopathy of prematurity screening</strong> (starting at 31 weeks PMA or 4 weeks postnatal age), <strong>Fenton growth chart</strong> plotting, and discharge readiness assessments.</p></div></div>
