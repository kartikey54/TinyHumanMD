      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Catch-Up Immunization Schedules</h2>

      <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question">What is a catch-up immunization schedule?<svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none"><path d="M4 6l4 4 4-4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"/></svg></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>A <strong>catch-up immunization schedule</strong> is a plan for children or adolescents who have missed one or more recommended vaccine doses. The CDC and Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP) publish catch-up schedules that specify <strong>minimum ages</strong> for each dose, <strong>minimum intervals</strong> between doses, and the maximum number of doses needed at each age.</p><p>The key principle of catch-up immunization is that <strong>vaccine series do not need to be restarted</strong> regardless of how much time has elapsed between doses. Previously administered valid doses still count, so the catch-up plan focuses on the remaining doses needed.</p></div></div>

      <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question">How do you determine which vaccines a child needs to catch up on?<svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none"><path d="M4 6l4 4 4-4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"/></svg></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>To determine the catch-up plan: (1) Identify the child's <strong>current age</strong>; (2) Review the <strong>documented vaccine history</strong> to count valid doses of each antigen; (3) Compare against the <strong>CDC recommended schedule</strong> to determine which doses are missing; (4) Apply <strong>minimum interval rules</strong> to calculate the earliest dates for each catch-up dose.</p><p>Important rules: Doses given before the <strong>minimum age</strong> are generally invalid and may need to be repeated. A 4-day grace period applies for doses given slightly before the minimum age or interval. Some vaccines like Hib and PCV have different schedules depending on the age at which the catch-up series starts.</p></div></div>

      <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question">What are minimum intervals between vaccine doses?<svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none"><path d="M4 6l4 4 4-4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"/></svg></button><div class="faq-answer"><p><strong>Minimum intervals</strong> are the shortest acceptable time between doses of the same vaccine. They ensure adequate immune response. Common examples: DTaP doses 1-3 require a <strong>4-week minimum interval</strong>, IPV doses have <strong>4-week minimum intervals</strong> between early doses and 6 months before the final dose, and MMR doses require <strong>4 weeks minimum</strong> between doses.</p><p>Administering vaccines too close together (shorter than the minimum interval) may reduce the immune response and the dose may be considered <strong>invalid</strong>. The general ACIP rule: if the interval was at least 4 days shorter than the minimum (the "4-day grace period"), the dose can still be counted as valid.</p></div></div>

      <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question">Can multiple vaccines be given at the same visit?<svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none"><path d="M4 6l4 4 4-4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"/></svg></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>Yes. <strong>Multiple vaccines can and should be given at the same visit</strong> when a child is behind on the schedule. This is both safe and recommended by the CDC. There is no limit to the number of vaccines that can be administered simultaneously, and giving multiple vaccines at once does not reduce their efficacy or increase the risk of adverse effects.</p><p>Some considerations: <strong>Live injectable vaccines</strong> (MMR, Varicella) that are not given at the same visit should be separated by at least <strong>28 days</strong>. <strong>Combination vaccines</strong> (e.g., Pediarix = DTaP-IPV-HepB) can reduce the number of injections needed. When many catch-up vaccines are due, providers may prioritize by disease risk and schedule additional visits 4 weeks apart.</p></div></div>

      <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question">What happens if a child starts a vaccine series late?<svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none"><path d="M4 6l4 4 4-4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"/></svg></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>When a child starts a vaccine series late, the <strong>number of doses needed may be reduced</strong>. For example, if a child receives their first Hib vaccine at 15 months or older, they only need <strong>one dose</strong> instead of the usual 3-4 dose series. Similarly, PCV15/PCV20 requires only one dose if started at 24 months or older in healthy children.</p><p>This is because older children have more mature immune systems that respond more robustly to vaccines. The CDC catch-up schedule provides specific dose recommendations based on the child's <strong>age at the first dose</strong> of each series, with fewer doses generally needed when starting at older ages.</p></div></div>

      <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question">Which childhood vaccines are required for school entry?<svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none"><path d="M4 6l4 4 4-4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"/></svg></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>School-entry vaccine requirements vary by state, but most states require proof of immunization for <strong>DTaP/Tdap</strong> (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis), <strong>IPV/OPV</strong> (polio), <strong>MMR</strong> (measles, mumps, rubella), <strong>Varicella</strong> (chickenpox or evidence of immunity), and <strong>Hepatitis B</strong>. Many states also require <strong>Hepatitis A</strong> and <strong>Meningococcal</strong> vaccines.</p><p>Children who are behind on vaccines can still attend school in most states with a <strong>provisional enrollment</strong> plan showing they are in the process of catching up. Medical, religious, or philosophical exemptions vary by state. The catch-up calculator helps identify exactly which doses are still needed to meet school entry requirements.</p></div></div>
