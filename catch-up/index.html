      <h2>Frequently Asked Questions About Catch-Up Immunization Schedules</h2>

      <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question">What is a catch-up immunization schedule?<svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none"><path d="M4 6l4 4 4-4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"/></svg></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>A <strong>catch-up immunization schedule</strong> is a plan for children or adolescents who have missed one or more recommended vaccine doses. The AAP catch-up schedule specifies <strong>minimum ages</strong>, <strong>minimum intervals</strong>, and age-based dose requirements for each antigen.</p><p>The key principle is that <strong>vaccine series generally do not need to be restarted</strong> regardless of time elapsed between doses. Previously administered valid doses still count, and the catch-up plan focuses on remaining doses and valid spacing.</p></div></div>

      <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question">How do you determine which vaccines a child needs to catch up on?<svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none"><path d="M4 6l4 4 4-4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"/></svg></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>To determine catch-up needs: (1) identify the child's <strong>current age</strong>; (2) review documented vaccine history to count valid doses by antigen; (3) compare against the <strong>AAP-endorsed routine and catch-up schedule</strong>; (4) apply <strong>minimum interval rules</strong> to determine when each remaining dose can be given.</p><p>Important rules: doses given before the <strong>minimum age</strong> are usually invalid and may need repetition. A 4-day grace period may apply in select scenarios. Some vaccines (for example Hib and PCV) have age-at-first-dose dependent schedules.</p></div></div>

      <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question">What are minimum intervals between vaccine doses?<svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none"><path d="M4 6l4 4 4-4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"/></svg></button><div class="faq-answer"><p><strong>Minimum intervals</strong> are the shortest acceptable time between doses of the same vaccine. They ensure adequate immune response. Common examples: DTaP doses 1-3 require a <strong>4-week minimum interval</strong>, IPV doses have <strong>4-week minimum intervals</strong> between early doses and 6 months before the final dose, and MMR doses require <strong>4 weeks minimum</strong> between doses.</p><p>Administering vaccines too close together (shorter than the minimum interval) may reduce the immune response and the dose may be considered <strong>invalid</strong>. The general ACIP rule: if the interval was at least 4 days shorter than the minimum (the "4-day grace period"), the dose can still be counted as valid.</p></div></div>

      <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question">Can multiple vaccines be given at the same visit?<svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none"><path d="M4 6l4 4 4-4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"/></svg></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>Yes. <strong>Multiple vaccines can and should be given at the same visit</strong> when a child is behind on schedule. This is consistent with AAP recommendations and national immunization administration guidance. Simultaneous administration does not reduce efficacy and is commonly used to accelerate catch-up.</p><p>Some considerations: <strong>Live injectable vaccines</strong> (MMR, Varicella) not given on the same day should be separated by at least <strong>28 days</strong>. <strong>Combination vaccines</strong> can reduce injection burden. Clinical judgment and local policy still apply.</p></div></div>

      <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question">What happens if a child starts a vaccine series late?<svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none"><path d="M4 6l4 4 4-4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"/></svg></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>When a child starts a series late, the <strong>total doses needed may be reduced</strong> depending on age at initiation and prior valid doses. For example, a first Hib dose at 15 months or older in a healthy child can complete that series; PCV catch-up can also use fewer doses at older ages.</p><p>AAP-endorsed catch-up guidance applies age-specific rules by antigen, so dose count and interval requirements must be interpreted in context of the child's age and history.</p></div></div>

      <div class="faq-item"><button class="faq-question">Which childhood vaccines are required for school entry?<svg width="16" height="16" viewBox="0 0 16 16" fill="none"><path d="M4 6l4 4 4-4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round"/></svg></button><div class="faq-answer"><p>School-entry vaccine requirements vary by state, but most states require proof of immunization for <strong>DTaP/Tdap</strong> (diphtheria, tetanus, pertussis), <strong>IPV/OPV</strong> (polio), <strong>MMR</strong> (measles, mumps, rubella), <strong>Varicella</strong> (chickenpox or evidence of immunity), and <strong>Hepatitis B</strong>. Many states also require <strong>Hepatitis A</strong> and <strong>Meningococcal</strong> vaccines.</p><p>Children who are behind on vaccines can still attend school in most states with a <strong>provisional enrollment</strong> plan showing they are in the process of catching up. Medical, religious, or philosophical exemptions vary by state. The catch-up calculator helps identify exactly which doses are still needed to meet school entry requirements.</p></div></div>
